Hello and welcome. I'm Charlie.

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:05,984
You're going to learn to write Python programs to solve practical problems.

3
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:08,065
And I'm Phillip. As Charlie said,

4
00:00:08,064 --> 00:00:10,140
you'll be learning about Python but we'll also be

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,225
demonstrating the skills you need to be an effective programmer.

6
00:00:13,224 --> 00:00:16,359
That's right. There's more to programming than just syntax.

7
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:20,680
For example, programmers need to be able to take an idea and turn it into code

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,120
and you'll need to be able to research solutions to novel problems.

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,810
First though, we should introduce ourselves better.

10
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:28,544
I've been using Python for seven years.

11
00:00:28,545 --> 00:00:30,155
Mostly as a web developer.

12
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,460
I've worked on payment portals,

13
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,310
internationalizations, web scrapers and general back end work.

14
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,388
Python is also my go to language for solving random problems.

15
00:00:38,387 --> 00:00:40,248
Even ones that aren't related to web development.

16
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:43,395
Yeah. Python is good for all sorts of things.

17
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:45,855
In my previous life, I was a mathematician.

18
00:00:45,854 --> 00:00:49,140
My first big Python project was working on Sage which

19
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,920
is open source mathematical software that I was using for my research.

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,100
It was surprisingly easy to get started on contributing to Sage

21
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,350
and the community taught me a lot.

22
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,640
It sounds like we've had pretty different experiences.

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,240
Here's hoping that this is the start of an exciting Python programming career for you.

24
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,310
Let's get to it.
